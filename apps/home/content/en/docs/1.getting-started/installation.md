# Installation

This page covers what you need before you can run the repository locally, and
roughly what "local development" means in this workspace.

## Prerequisites

You need the following tools:

| Tool        | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Node.js 24+ | Runtime for tooling and the build |
| pnpm 12+    | Package manager for the workspace |
| Git         | Version control                   |

The exact versions are pinned in the repository: `.node-version` pins Node.js
and the `packageManager` field in `package.json` pins pnpm. Use Corepack or
install those versions directly and the whole toolchain agrees.

> **Note** — macOS users may need `watchman` for file watching if the DevTools
> watcher reports unrelated rebuilds.

## The repository and workspace

The repository is a **monorepo** managed with [Nx](https://nx.dev/) and pnpm:

```text
apps/    runtime and deploy units (web apps, services)
libs/    shared libraries owned by bounded contexts
docs/    architecture and operations documentation
tools/   developer tooling such as the `dx` CLI
```

The pnpm workspace covers `apps/*`, `tools/*` and `docs`; the libraries under
`libs/` are Nx projects without their own `package.json`, resolved through
workspace aliases. Everything else in that layout is a pnpm workspace package.
The `apps/home` package is the public app you are reading right now — docs and
blog included.

## Local development overview

The typical loop has three steps.

### Install the dependencies

From the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Prepare the Nuxt types

Nuxt generates the `.nuxt/` type files once before the first run:

```bash
cd apps/home
pnpm exec nuxt prepare
```

### Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm exec nuxt dev
```

The dev server is then available at `http://localhost:4200`, for example:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:4200/en/docs/getting-started
```

Run the unit tests for a single app from the workspace root:

```bash
pnpm exec nx test home
```

## What happens during a build

The public app is a **Cloudflare Worker with SSR**: `nitro.config.ts` selects
the `cloudflare-module` preset, and the content pages are prerendered at build
time on Node — where content queries are allowed — so no runtime database is
involved. Building the Nx target runs Nuxt:

```bash
npx nx build @ecoma-io/home
```

The output lands in `apps/home/.output`:

```text
.output/server/index.mjs  the Worker entry script
.output/public/           prerendered content HTML, one directory per route
.output/public/_nuxt/     hashed client assets
.output/public/__nuxt_content/  the content database dump
```

`wrangler.jsonc` points the Worker at that output and deploys the prerendered
pages as Worker static assets — `nx deploy @ecoma-io/home` builds first, then
publishes the bundle.

> **Warning** — never commit secrets into `.dev.vars*` or `.env*`. Local Worker
> configuration is for development only.
