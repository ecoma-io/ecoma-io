# Building a Public Page

A public page on Ecoma is a composition of four layers:

```text
apps/<app>      →  the application: routing, content, docs-specific UI
        ↓
layout-public   →  PublicShell, global navigation, mount topology
        ↓
i18n-public     →  locale dimension: registry, parse, switch
        ↓
content         →  localized markdown rendered from the content tree
```

## 1. The application owns routing and content

The docs app defines one file-based route for all documentation content. The
route validates the pathname against the shared topology contract and then
resolves a document from the content collection:

```ts
// pseudo-code for the docs route
const layout = parsePublicLayoutPath(route.path);
// accept only kind === 'localized' && mount === 'docs'
```

If the topology is invalid, the route is rejected before any content lookup; if
the content does not exist, the page is a 404.

## 2. layout-public provides the shell

Every docs page renders the shared shell instead of its own header and footer:

```vue
<PublicShell :path="route.path">
  <!-- docs content -->
</PublicShell>
```

The shell parses the pathname once, renders the header (brand, global
navigation, locale switcher) and the footer, and never needs reimplementing per
app.

## 3. i18n-public owns the locale

Locales, their metadata, and switching between them all come from `i18n-public`.
When you switch language on a docs page, the shell calls `switchLocale()` to
keep the same document and change only the locale segment:

```text
/en/docs/concepts/public-web
        ↓
/vi/docs/concepts/public-web
```

The docs app never reimplements locale parsing or path rewriting.

## 4. Content renders locally

The page queries the `docs` collection by the exact pathname and renders the
document with `ContentRenderer`, so the typography you see — headings, code
blocks, tables, blockquotes — is the app-local rendering, not a global
rendering service.

> This page is an illustration of the composition, not a specification of a
> generic page-builder framework. The actual contracts live in the repository.
